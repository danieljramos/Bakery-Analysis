Goal: Understand the drops in customers and sales.

Big Idea: A pricing strategy based on profitability will avoid unnecessary changes that result in losing customers that are difficult to win back.

Description: This analysis was requested to understand why a bakery was losing customers from September 2021. In the analysis we show the historical data of the bakery, the sample includes data from January 2021 and September 2022.
Once we understand the situation and what is causing the loss of customers. I can give advices on the strategy and steps to avoid losing more customers and try to win them back.
