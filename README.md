# Bakery-Analysis
Analysis of the historical status of a bakery.

This analysis was created to understand why a bakery was losing customers from September 2021. In the analysis we show the historical data of the bakery, the sample includes data from January 2021 and September 2022.
Once we understand the situation and what is causing the loss of customers. I can give advice on the strategy and steps to avoid losing more customers and try to win them back.
